This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(NHANES)
data('NHANES')

```

1. What is the 90th percentile of systolic blood pressure (first reading) for men versus women?

```{r}
NHANES %>% group_by(Gender) %>% summarise(the_90th_percentile_of_systolic_blood_pressure=quantile(BPSys1,.9, na.rm=TRUE))

```


2. What is the breakdown for education level for people in this dataset? How many people are in
each type of group?

```{r}
NHANES %>% group_by(Education) %>% summarise(population_in_this_group=n())
```


3. What is the mean and median age for people with and without diabetes?

```{r}
NHANES %>% group_by(Diabetes) %>% summarise(mean=mean(Age),median=median(Age))
```


4. What is the second highest systolic blood pressure? How many people have this SBP?

```{r}
NHANES  %>% select(BPSys1) %>% group_by(BPSys1) %>% summarise(num=n())%>% arrange(desc(BPSys1)) %>% slice(2) %>% rename(second_highest_systolic_blood_pressure=BPSys1, number_of_people_having_this_SBP=num)
```


Read in the 2015-2016 NHANES demographics data from the CDC website (just like in
homework). This dataset has a variable WTINT2YR, which tells you how many people (in the
U.S. population) are similar to that person who was included in the survey. For example, if a
person had a weight of 1000, that would mean that 1000 people in all of the U.S. have similar
characteristics.
 

5. What is the U.S. population? Hint: use the weighting variable above to figure it out.

```{r}
library(haven)
wtint2yr=read_xpt('https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2015-2016/DEMO_I.XPT')
```

```{r}
wtint2yr %>% summarise(U.S.population=sum(WTINT2YR)) 
```

6. What are the proportions of race across the U.S population? How does your answer differ if you consider each row as a single person versus if you take the weighting variable into account?

```{r}
# I use each row as weighting variable 
wtint2yr %>% 
  group_by(RIDRETH3) %>% 
  summarise(population_per_group=sum(WTINT2YR)) %>%
  mutate(Proportion=population_per_group/sum(population_per_group)) %>% mutate(RIDRETH3=c('Mexican American', 'Other Hispanic', 'Non-Hispanic White', 'Non-Hispanic Black', 'Non-Hispanic Asian', 'Other Race - Including Multi-Racial')) %>% 
  rename(Race=RIDRETH3)
```

```{r}
# I use each row as a single person
wtint2yr %>% group_by(RIDRETH3) %>% summarise(population_per_group=n()) %>% mutate(Proportion=population_per_group/sum(population_per_group)) %>% mutate(RIDRETH3=c('Mexican American', 'Other Hispanic', 'Non-Hispanic White', 'Non-Hispanic Black', 'Non-Hispanic Asian', 'Other Race - Including Multi-Racial')) %>% 
  rename(Race=RIDRETH3)
```

It can be seen that if I use each row as a single person, the population of each race is clearly too little, and the proportion is bigger than that when I use each row as weighting variable.
