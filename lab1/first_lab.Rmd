```{r}
library(tidyverse)
data(package='MASS')
data(Pima.tr, package='MASS')
view(Pima.tr)

# you have to do 2 question marks because we never "libraried in" the MASS package
??Pima.tr
```

# Descriptive stats (in-class notes)

```{r}
Pima.tr$npreg
summary(Pima.tr)
str(Pima.tr)
summary(Pima.tr$npreg)
table(Pima.tr$npreg)
table(Pima.tr$type)
str(Pima.tr$type)

# Question 1: How many rows and columns are in the dataset?

```{r}
install.packages('NHANES')
data(NHANES, package = 'NHANES')
```

```{r}
str(NHANES)
```
There are 76 colums and 10000 rows in the dataset. 


# Question 2: What is the distribution (6-number summary) for the systolic blood pressure (first reading only)?

```{r}
summary(NHANES$BPSys1 )
```

# Question 3: Directly calculate the mean and median systolic blood pressure (SBP) using the mean() and median() functions.

```{r}
mean(NHANES$BPSys1, na.rm= TRUE)
median(NHANES$BPSys1, na.rm= TRUE)
```


# Question 4: What is the 10th and 90th percentile for systolic blood pressure?
```{r}
quantile(NHANES$BPSys1, c(0.1,0.9), na.rm= TRUE)
```


# Question 5: What is the second highest systolic blood pressure? How many people have this SBP?

```{r}
table(NHANES$BPSys1)
```
The second highest systolic blood pressure is 224, and there are 2 people having this SBP.


# Question 6: What is the breakdown for education level for people in this dataset? How many people are in each type of group?

```{r}
table(NHANES$Education)
```
